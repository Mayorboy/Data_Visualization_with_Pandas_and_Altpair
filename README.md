# Main File
Weather_visualization.ipynb is the project's main notebook file. Just so you know, charts can't render on Git Hub, so the error results from that. 
A resaved version and output is the png, which works well. The code works fine on Jupyter Notebook.

# Data_Visualization_with_Pandas_and_Altpair
import pandas with dataset from URL with my city weather information, concatenated together and visuals showing comparison and 
visuals with Altair together.

### Error Display...Undergoing a possible fix remotely
Charts are unable to render on Git Hub. Hence, PNG and display were imported for the Altair vega set library.
